## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was mainly applying what I know and practicing.

Most interesting was focussing on making sure that you can go through the page with a keyboard. I already knew this should be doen for accessability, but now I also made sure and checked if it worked.

### Continued development

In the future I want to keep on focussing on accesability, for example through checking keyboard use of the website.

Implementing fonts I read and heared a bit more about as a result of this challenge. I believe I can learn a lot more about this.
